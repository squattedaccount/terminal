# techno_punks Code of Conduct (Punk Edition)

We build in public. We hack with intent. We keep each other safe.

## The Vibe (TL;DR)
- Be sharp. Be kind. Be real.
- No harassment, no hate, no doxxing, no scams.
- DIY > ego. Collaborate, don’t gatekeep.
- Debate the idea, not the human.

## Do
- Help newcomers. Document your hacks. Share context.
- Credit others. Ask for consent when using someone’s work.
- Use clear language. Mark speculation. Flag risks.
- Report bugs, security issues, and suspicious behavior.

## Don’t
- Harass, threaten, stalk, or discriminate.
- Post hate speech, sexualized content, or violent imagery targeted at anyone.
- Spam, phish, dox, or attempt unauthorized access.

## Zero‑Tolerance List
- Hate or slurs targeting identity (race, ethnicity, nationality, caste, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, disability, serious disease, or age).
- Direct threats, doxxing, or incitement of harm.
- Malicious exploitation of community members or the codebase.

## Scope
- Applies to all project spaces: repo, issues, PRs, discussions, wikis, packages, social repos, and live spaces (chat/voice/video).
- Includes official off-platform spaces, e.g. Discord: https://discord.com/invite/DFRcYgJGag

## Reporting
- Open a GitHub issue with the "coc" label if safe to do so.
- Or DM moderators on Discord if you need privacy.
- For urgent safety concerns: stop, document, and ping mods immediately.

## Consequences
- Soft nudge → warning → kick/ban → report, depending on severity.
- Maintainers may remove content, restrict access, or escalate without prior notice to protect the community.

## Disputes
- If you think an action was unfair, appeal privately to the maintainers. We’ll review with context.

## Attribution
- Inspired by punk ethics and community safety norms. Steal this, remix it, make it better.

## Legal
- This is a community guideline, not legal advice. See `commands.legal` in `js/i18n/languages/en.json` for project disclaimers.

## Version
- v1.0 — minimal, living document. Expect edits as the movement grows.
